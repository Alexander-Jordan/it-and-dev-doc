# Module 1: Introduction & Overview of the Computer

# Module 2: Motherboard (The spinal cord of the computer)

## Lesson 1

### Chipset (group of circuits or chips):
	Intel vs AMD
		Not same manufacturer (could be Samsung for example)
		But the architecture is designed by Intel or AMD
		Mostly the same thing, but good to know the difference
	Northbridge (MCH: Memory Controller Hub)
		1 of 2 main chips controlling communication on a motherboard
		High data transfer devices (HIGH: NORTH)
		High Speed Graphics
		Memory (RAM)
	Southbridge (ICH: I/O Controller Hub)
		1 of 2 main chips controlling communication on a motherboard
		Low data transfer devices (LOW: SOUTH)
		Most input/output devices
		Hard drives, USB, ethernet, etc
	DMI (Direct Media Interface)
		Connects Northbridge & Southbridge

### Buses(one wire or a group of wires that transferes data):
	Front-side Bus (Intel) & HyperTransport Bus (AMD)
		The wire (bus) connecting the CPU to the Northbridge
	Memory Bus
		Same thing, the wire (bus) connectin memory (RAM) to the Northbridge
	Expansion Bus
		Expansions like addable memory or other stuff can be added

### Lane (Two wires that enable sending & receiving data simultaneously)

### Parallel vs Serial (sending multiple/on bits/bit of data at a time (stil one way))
	Bits (b) vs Bytes (B = 8 bits)


## Lesson 2

### Expansion Buses
	ISA (Industry Standard Architecture)
		Old, and not that common anymore
	PCI (Peripheral Component Interconnect)
		One of the more common expansion buses
		PCI
			Bus Width: 32-bit
			Freq: 33, 66 MHz
			Max Data Rate: 133, 266 MB/s
		PCIe (e: express. Most common & fastest)
			Bus Width: Serial, 1-16 full duplex lanes
			Freq: 2.5 (ver 1), 5 (ver 2), 8 (ver 3) GHz
			Max Data Rate: 250, 500 MB/s, 1 GB/s per lane
		PCIx (x: extended)
		mini-PCI (more for laptops)
	AGP (Accelerated Graphics Port)
		Specificly made for graphics
		PCIe replaced AGP
			Bus Width: 32-bit
			Freq: 1x, 2x, 4x, 8x 66MHz
			Max Data Rate: 266, 533 MB/s, 1, 2 GB/s
	AMR (Audio/Modem Riser) & CNR (Communication/Networking Riser)
		CNR replaced AMR
		Not so common because of PCIe replacing them
		Specific for sound & modems / audio & networking
	PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association)
		Cards for laptops, plugged in

### Storage Technology
	PATA (Parallel AT Attachment) / IDE (Integrated Driv Electronics)
		40-pin bus (molex)
		Can hold 2 devices
	SATA (Serial AT Attachment)
		Faster
		Can hold 1 device


## Lesson 3

### Input/Output Ports

### Front Panel Connectors
