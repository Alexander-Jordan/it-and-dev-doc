# 167. Cross-component scripts

If you need to share data across the same type of component, then the default script tag in all svelte components is not that useful.

Like we learned earlier, in contrast to normal JS, svelte runs the code in a components script tag every time a component is added.

So in the case of our `FamilyNode` component, this script block will run every time a new member is displayed.

To have something run just once for a specific svelte component regardless of how many are added of that component, we add another script tag and set the `context` to `module`:

```js
<script context="module">
    ...
</script>
```

This could be useful to have data that all components of the same type should share, and not instantiate their own version of that data.

Modifying the `FamilyNode` component a bit, we could say that we want to highlight the name we click on, and deselect it if we click on another name.
We could then store the information we need to know which one to deactivate in this shareable script tag.
Then we could look for that information and deactivate the correct name, before we activate the name we currently click on:

```svelte
<script context="module">
    let deactivateNode;
</script>

<script>
    export let member;

    let isActive;

    function deactivate() {
        isActive = false;
    }

    function activate() {
        if (deactivateNode) {
            deactivateNode();
        }
        isActive = true;
        deactivateNode = deactivate;
    }
</script>

<style>
    .active {
        color: red;
    }
</style>

<h1 on:click={activate} class:active={isActive}>{member.name}</h1>
{#if member.isParent}
    <ul>
        {#each member.children as child}
            <li>
                <svelte:self member={child} />
            </li>
        {/each}
    </ul>
{/if}
```

NOTE: have in mind that for 99% of the time you'll want to use the normal script tag in svelte.
