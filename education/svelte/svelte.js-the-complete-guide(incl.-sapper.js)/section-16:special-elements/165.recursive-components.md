# 165. Recursive components


Let's say that I have a `familyStructure` object, which contains family members and all their children as a object prop for each parent:

**App.svelte**
```js
let familyStructure = [
    {
        isParent: true,
        name: 'Chris',
        children: [
            {
                isParent: true,
                name: 'Moe',
                children: [
                    {
                        isParent: false,
                        name: 'Julie'
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    { isParent: false, name: 'Anna' }
];
```

Let's say we have a `FamilyNode` component, which displays the name of a family member and, if they are a parent, all their children's names as well:

**FamilyNode.svelte**
```svelte
<script>
    export let member;
</script>

<h1>{member.name}</h1>
{#if member.isParent}
    <ul>
        {#each member.children as child}
            <li>{child.name}</li>
        {/each}
    </ul>
{/if}
```

And then we loop through our `familyStructure` object to display all of them:

**App.svelte**
```svelte
{#each familyStructure as familyMember}
    <FamilyNode member={familyMember} />
{/each}
```

But what about grand children? Should we have an if clause inside the `FamilyNode` to check for this as well somehow? It would be better if we could reuse the same component, but inside the component itself. This is what svelte's recursive components are for:

```svelte
<svelte:self />
<!-- OR -->
<svelte:self></svelte:self>
```

You can then include any props or content that your component need as normal. So we can update the `FamilyNode` component like this:

```svelte
<h1>{member.name}</h1>
{#if member.isParent}
    <ul>
        {#each member.children as child}
            <li>
                <svelte:self member={child} />
            </li>
        {/each}
    </ul>
{/if}
```

Now all family member's names will display in the correct hierarchy!
