# 1. Introduction

Welcome to this Svelte.js course.

## In this course

You will learn Svelte syntax, how it works, and the code it generates, 

We will start with the basics, and work our way up to serverless rendering.

You will learn how to output/recalculate data, trigger events, send HTTP requests, manage stores/states, and more.

## Structure of the course

This course includes `Theory Chapters`, which will include smaller unpolished demos where the focus is on a new concept being explained.

Then we will take what we learned and apply it in the course main project `MeetUp planner`, so that you get to work on a bigger application.

At the end you will also learn how to deploy this application.

Also at the end we will go over why you should learn Svelte, and maybe any other JS framework.
