# 56. Component communication overview

Usually have a tree of components:

```
App
    Products
        ProductsItem
    Cart
        ...
    ...
```

What should happen if we want to add and item to the cart?
It's not a direct child of the `Cart` component.

The `Products: [{...}]` could be managed by the `App`
 component.

 The data can be passed down to the `ProductItem` component via props.

 We can emit a custom event like an `add` event, which pass down data from the `App` to the `Cart` component.

 This is a method that is used all the time in Svelte.
