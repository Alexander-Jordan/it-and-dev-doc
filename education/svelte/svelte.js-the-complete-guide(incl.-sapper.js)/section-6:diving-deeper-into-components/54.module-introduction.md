# 54. Module Introduction

In this module we will have a deeper look into components, which are the building blocks for all Svelte apps.

We will solve some issues we have in our project already.

And we will solve some of them by learning about creating and using our own events.

There will be more useful tips and trick in this module, about how to create and manage our components better.
