# 61. Working with slots

## What are `Slots`?

Parts of a child components markup that a parent component can insert dynamic markup.

## Modal example

Add a new `Modal.svelte` file:

```svelte
<script>
    export let content;
</script>

<style>
    .backdrop {
        position: fixed;
        top: 0;
        left: 0;
        width: 100%;
        height: 100vh;
        background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);
        z-index: 10;
    }

    .modal {
        padding: 1rem;
        position: fixed;
        top: 10vh;
        left: 10%;
        width: 80%;
        max-height: 80vh;
        background: white;
        border-radius: 5px;
        z-index: 100;
        box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.26);
        overflow: scroll;
    }
</style>

<div class="backdrop"></div>
<div class="modal">{content}</div>
```

Include it in the markup in `App.svelte`:

```svelte
<Modal content={"Hi!"} />
```

If we want to use HTML as content, then you might think of using the `@html` in front of the content prop:

```svelte
<div class="modal">{@html content}</div>
```

And then we can use HTML in `App`:

```svelte
<Modal content={"<h1>Hi!</h1>"} />
```

But that is not the way we want to write HTML to our components. Would be better if we could add the `<Modal>` tag with opening and closing tags, and in between our content, as normal HTML tags:

```svelte
<Modal>
    <h1>Hi!</h1>
</Modal>
```

To let the modal know where to put this `<h1>` tag, we use slots.

NOTE: slots are actually vanilla JS, you can read more about it [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/slot)

Remove the `content` prop from `Modal` entirely, and instead add `<slot />` inside the modal `<div>` tag:

```svelte
<div class="modal">
    <slot />
</div>
```

The `<slot>` tag will add whatever you put in between the tags of this component to the place where this `<slot>` tag is added.

This makes it possible for you to add any type of HTML content to components dynamically from the parent component.
