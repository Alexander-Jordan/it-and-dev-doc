# 36. Understanding event modifiers

DOM event handlers, for example `on:click`, can have modifiers that alter their behavior.

You modify it by postfix the event with a pipe (`|`), following one of the available modifiers:

- `preventDefault` (calls `event.preventDefault()` before running the handler)
- `stopPropagation` (calls `event.stopPropagation()`, preventing the event reaching the next element)
- `passive` (improves scrolling performance on touch/wheel events (will be added automatically here it's safe to do so))
- `nonpassive` (set `passive: false`)
- `capture` (fires the handler during the capture phase instead of the bubbling phase)
- `once` (makes it work only once)
- `self` (only trigger handler if `event.target` is the element itself)
- `trusted` (only triggered if `event.isTrusted` is `true`, meaning the event was triggered by a user action, not through `element.dispatchEvent()`)

It's also possible to chain modifiers.
