# 75. Communicating between components

First let's fix the styling a bit for the button, by wrapping it with a div which contains the class `meetup-controls`.
Then add some style to that class:

```svelte
<style>
...
    .meetup-controls {
        margin: 1rem;
    }
</style>

...
<div class="meetup-controls">
    <Button caption="New Meetup" on:click={() => editMode = 'add'} />
</div>
```

Adjust the `addMeetup` function to use an `event` parameter to get the data from the event details.
Also set `editMode` to `null` at the end:

```js
function addMeetup(event) {
    const newMeetup = {
        id: Math.random().toString,
        title: event.detail.title,
        subtitle: event.detail.subtitle,
        description: event.detail.description,
        imageUrl: event.detail.imageUrl,
        address: event.detail.address,
        contactEmail: event.detail.email
    }

    meetups = [newMeetup, ...meetups];
    editMode = null;
}
```

Now use this method when the `on:save` event is fired on the `EditMeetup` component in the markup:

```svelte
<EditMeetup on:save={addMeetup} />
```

Now you can add new meetups like you could before, but with the form hidden before you click on the button to show it.
