# 78. Finishing the `Modal` component

Now we're gonna fix the submit button.

First add a new function in `EditMeetup.svelte`, named `cancelForm`.
It should simply dispatch an event called `cancel`:

```js
function cancelForm() {
    dispatch('cancel');
}
```

If you haven't already, remove the submit button.
Instead, below the `<form>` tag, add a `<div>` tag with a `slot` attribute set to `footer`:

```svelte
<form>
...
</form>
<div slot="footer">
</div>
```

Inside this `<div>` tag, add 2 `<Button>` tags, one named `Cancel`, and one named `Submit`.
For the cancel button, set the `mode` prop to `outline`, and add a `on:click` event to trigger the `cancelForm` function.
For the submit button, add a `on:click` event to trigger the `submitForm` function, since it is now outside the form:

```svelte
<div slot="footer">
    <Button mode="outline" on:click={cancelForm}>Cancel</Button>
    <Button on:click={submitForm}>Submit</Button>
</div>
```

Also, since the `App` component already listens for the `cancel` event from the `EditMeetup` component, you don't need to add anything else.
Now it should work as before with the cancel button, but now you can also submit the form.
