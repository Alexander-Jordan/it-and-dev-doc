# 13. More reactivity

The reactive syntax `$:` can be used to more than just variable assignments.
It can also be used for any other code.

For example: `$: console.log(name);` will print out the value of `name` in the console each time the `name` variable is changed.

You can also for example use it in conjunction with an if statement:

```js
$: if (name === 'Your-full-name') {
    age = 31
}
```

This will change the value of `age` to `31` when the value of `name` is changed to `Your-full-name`.

NOTE: when the `age` value is changed, it doesn't trigger this reactivity, but increments with one as normal.
