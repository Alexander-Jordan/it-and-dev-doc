# 15. Two-way binding shortcut

In the situation where we in the last chapter added an input binding and an output binding separately, Svelte has a shortcut.

The `value="{name}" on:input="{nameInput}"` part added to the new input field, can be simplified with the `bind` shortcut: `bind:value="{name}"`.

This will display the initial value of `name` on the input field (input binding), but it will also change the value of `name` whenever the value of the input is changed (output binding), in this case when the user types something in the input field.
After these changes, you can remove the unused function `nameInput`, save, and see that it works as before.

This is called `Two-way binding`.

NOTE: I would recommend not overusing it, to only do if there is a good reason, as in this example.
