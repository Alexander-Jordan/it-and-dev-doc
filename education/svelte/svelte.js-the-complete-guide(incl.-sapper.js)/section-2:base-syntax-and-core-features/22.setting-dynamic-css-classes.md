# 22. Setting dynamic CSS classes

Dynamic classes can be added to HTML elements by adding some kind of ternary if statement inside curly braces.
Like the `<div class="thumb">` tag:

```svelte
<div class="{userImgSrc ? "thumb" : "thumb thumb-placeholder"}">
```

This code will add a second class called `thumb-placeholder` to the `<div>` tag if the `userImgSrc` variable isn't set.

To make it change style, add this styling to the `thumb-placeholder` class in the style block:

```css
.thumb-placeholder {
    background: #ccc;
}
```

This will add a gray background color to the thumbnail if no URL is provided.

## Simplify

But this ternary could be simplified:

```svelte
<div class="thumb" class:thumb-placeholder="{!userImgSrc}">
```

The `class:conditional-class` syntax is something svelte understands as if the condition is true, the class will be added.
If not, it will not be added.
So in the case above it's adding the `thumb-placeholder` class only if the `userImgSrc` variable is not set to any value.

Save, and test by emptying the URL input field.
The thumbnail background should be gray.
