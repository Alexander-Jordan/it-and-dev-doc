# 20. Outputting HTML content

If you include any HTML in for example the description textarea, svelte will by default not output it as HTML but plain text.
This is good for security.

## Overriding the default behavior

NOTE: if you want to display user input as HTML, make sure to **always sanitize** before outputting it anywhere in your application.

When the content is safe to output as HTML, add `@html` in front of the variable or text you want to output as HTML in the markup block.
For example, in the `ContactCard`, the `@html` key can be added inside the `<p>{description}</p>` tag like this:

```svelte
<p>{@html description}</p>
```

If you save it, and include some HTML syntax in the description textarea, then this will be rendered as HTML, not plain text.
You can even include a `<script>` tag, which shows that this now could be used for XSS attacks.
You can remove it after testing it out.
