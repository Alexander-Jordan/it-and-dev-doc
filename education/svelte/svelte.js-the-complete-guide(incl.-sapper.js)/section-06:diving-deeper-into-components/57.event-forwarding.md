# 57. Event forwarding

Starting fresh with a new example project, and add a `Product.svelte` component to the `src` folder.

**Product.svelte**
```svelte
<script>
    export let productTitle;
</script>

<article>
    <h1>{productTitle}</h1>
    <button>Add to Cart</button>
    <button>Delete</button>
</article>
```

**App.svelte**
```svelte
<script>
	import Product from './Product.svelte'
</script>

<Product productTitle='A Book' />
```

To forward an event, like the `on:click` event, to the parent component, we add `on:click` to a element in the `Product` component but without targeting any function. For example the `Add to Cart` button:

```svelte
<button on:click>Add to Cart</button>
```

If we run this and click the button, nothing happens since we didn't target any functionality to the event.

In `App.svelte` we can add a target on the `<Product />` tag:

```svelte
<Product productTitle='A Book' on:click={() => alert('Clicked!')}/>
```

When we run this and click the button, an alert pops up like we'd expect.

If you remove the `on:click` from the `<button>` tag in `Product.svelte`, this will not get forwarded to the parent, and won't work anymore.

Experiment: Adding the `on:click` forwarding to the delete button as well will lead to the same behavior as the first button.
