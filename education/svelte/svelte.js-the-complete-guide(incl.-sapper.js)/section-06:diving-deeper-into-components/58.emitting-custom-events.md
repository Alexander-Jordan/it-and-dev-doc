# 58. Emitting custom events

We have 2 buttons, but we need them to do 2 different things. It would be nice to be able to say something like:

```svelte
on:add-to-cart={...}
on:delete={...}
```

We can do this by adding custom events.

First we need to import the `createEventDispatcher` function from the `svelte` package included in our `package.json`. Import it in the `Product.svelte` file, and set it to a variable we'll name `dispatch`. Then, create a function called `addToCart` which creates a new event using this `dispatch` function variable:

```js
import { createEventDispatcher } from 'svelte';

const dispatch = createEventDispatcher();

function addToCart() {
    dispatch(...);
}
```

The `createEventDispatcher` function takes 2 arguments: the name of the new event, and any optional data you want to pass along.

For this function we can name the event `add-to-cart` and pass an object with an `id` set to `p1`:

```js
dispatch('add-to-cart', {id: 'p1'});
```

Make one for the delete button as well, and call the event `delete`. Then target these functions on the buttons:

```svelte
<button on:click={addToCart}>Add to Cart</button>
<button on:click={() => dispatch('delete', 'p1')}>Delete</button>
```

Lastly, in `App.svelte`, the `<Product />` tag can be updated like this:

```svelte
<Product
	productTitle='A Book'
	on:add-to-cart={() => alert('Add to cart!')}
	on:delete={() => alert('Delete!')}
/>
```

Now both buttons act different using custom events.
