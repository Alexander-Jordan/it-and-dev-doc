# 59. How to extract event data

In `App.svelte`, add 2 new functions, one for each button, that will `console.log` the event:

```js
function addToCart(event) {
    console.log(event);
}

function deleteProduct(event) {
    console.log(event);
}
```

Update the markup to use these functions:

```svelte
<Product
	productTitle='A Book'
	on:add-to-cart={addToCart}
	on:delete={deleteProduct}
/>
```

When clicking the buttons we'll get a normal event object printed in the console. The interesting part is the `detail` property, which contains the data we sent with the event.

So to extract the data sent with an event, you just add `event.detail` to the console logs:

```js
function addToCart(event) {
    console.log(event.detail);
}

function deleteProduct(event) {
    console.log(event.detail);
}
```

Now you can not only pass data down the component tree, but also up.
