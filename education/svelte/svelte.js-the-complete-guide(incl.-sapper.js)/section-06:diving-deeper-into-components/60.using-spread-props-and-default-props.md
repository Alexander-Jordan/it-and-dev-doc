# 60. Using spread props & default props

Let's say that our `Product` component has 3 props, id, title & price:

```svelte
<script>
    import { createEventDispatcher } from 'svelte';

    export let id;
    export let title;
    export let price;

    const dispatch = createEventDispatcher();

    function addToCart() {
        dispatch('add-to-cart', {id: id});
    }
</script>

<article>
    <h1>{title}</h1>
    <h2>${price}</h2>
    <button on:click={addToCart}>Add to Cart</button>
    <button on:click={() => dispatch('delete', id)}>Delete</button>
</article>
```

And let's say that in `App.svelte` we have an object with products stored in a variable, which we iterate over to display the different products:

```svelte
<script>
	import Product from './Product.svelte'

	let products = [
		{
			id: 'p1',
			title: 'A book',
			price: 9.99
		}
	]

	function addToCart(event) {
		console.log(event.detail);
	}

	function deleteProduct(event) {
		console.log(event.detail);
	}
</script>

{#each products as product (product.id)}
	<Product
		title={product.title}
		price={product.price}
		on:add-to-cart={addToCart}
		on:delete={deleteProduct}
	/>
{/each}
```

When we add the different props we currently add them like `prop={product.prop}`. But with the `spread syntax`, if all props of the data object match the names of the props on the Svelte component, all props can be simplified to `{...product}`:

```svelte
{#each products as product (product.id)}
	<Product
		{...product}
		on:add-to-cart={addToCart}
		on:delete={deleteProduct}
	/>
{/each}
```

NOTE: props on data objects that doesn't exist as a prop on the component doesn't resolve to an error. So you don't have to include them in the component in order to make use of this syntax. But to make it work with existing props in the component, the naming MUST match exactly.

We could also add optional props to the Svelte component.
For example we could add a `bestseller` prop to the `Product` component, and add a `<h3>` tag conditionally to if this prop is set to `true`:

```svelte
export let bestseller;
...

{#if bestseller}
    <h3>BESTSELLER</h3>
{/if}
```


If this is not included as a prop in the data object, we will still not get an error, but a warning. To get rid of this warning, we need to give this prop a default value:

```js
export let bestseller = false;
```

That is how we set default props.
