# 42. Different ways of mounting components

## Add component to HTML target

You could use Svelte components like you do with the `App` component in `main.js`.
All you have to do is to target an HTML element in your single page (`html.index`), to be used as the target element for you component.
Your component will be rendered inside this target element.

## Import component from another component

The other way is how we do it with the `Header` component inside the `App.svelte` file.

## When to use what

The first method doesn't allow for communication between components that are added separately in the HTML single page.
But in the second method the `App` & the `Header` component can communicate.

So a good standard is: only use the first method if you need 2 separated components that are not part of each other and should not communicate, like 2 apps.
In all other cases, use the first method.
