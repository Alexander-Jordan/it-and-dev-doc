# 48. Adding a `MeetupGrid` component

## Create the component

Create a new file inside the `Meetups` folder, named `MeetupGrid.svelte`.
Then move the entire `<section id="meetups">` tag with it's content from `App` to this new component:

```svelte
<section id="meetups">
    {#each meetups as meetup}
        <MeetupItem
            title={meetup.title}
            subtitle={meetup.subtitle}
            description={meetup.description}
            imageUrl={meetup.imageUrl}
            address={meetup.address}
            email={meetup.contactEmail}
        />
    {/each}
</section>
```

Add a the necessary imports and variables to a script block:

```svelte
<script>
    import MeetupItem from "./MeetupItem.svelte";

    export let meetups;
</script>
```

Lastly, some styling:

```svelte
<style>
    section {
        width: 100%;
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr;
        grid-gap: 1rem;
    }

    @media (min-width: 768px) {
        section {
            grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
        }
    }
</style>
```

## Use the new component

In `App.svelte` we want to replace the `<section>` tag with this new component.
So start by removing that entire element, with it's content.

Replace it with a `<main>` tag, and inside add the `MeetupGrid` component, together with the `meetups` prop:

```svelte
<main>
    <MeetupGrid {meetups}/>
</main>
```

Lastly, we need to change the styling in `App.svelte` to not target the `#meetups`, but instead this new `<main>` tag:

```css
main {
    margin-top: 5rem;
}
```
