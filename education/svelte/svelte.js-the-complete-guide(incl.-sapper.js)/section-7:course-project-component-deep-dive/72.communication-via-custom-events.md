# 71. Communication via custom events

Let's put into practice what we learned about custom events and forwarding events to parent components.

We want to be able to favorite a meetup via the favorite button on the `MeetupItem`. We do this by creating a new event called `togglefavorite` that gets dispatched when the favorite button is clicked, and we pass the `id` of the `MeetupItem` with that event.

```svelte
<Button
    mode="outline"
    caption={isFavorite ? 'Unfavorite' : 'Favorite'}
    on:click={() => dispatch('togglefavorite', id)}
/>
```

We need to add an `id` & an `isFavorite` variable and export them. We also need to import the `createEventDispatcher` from `svelte`, which we use to set the `dispatch` constant variable:

```js
import { createEventDispatcher } from "svelte";
...

export let id;
...
export let isFavorite;

const dispatch = createEventDispatcher();
```

## `Button`

We need to forward the `on:click` event on the button element, so it can be used by the `MeetupItem`:

```svelte
<button class={mode} {type} on:click>{caption}</button>
```

## `MeetupGrid`

We need to give the new `id` & `isFavorite` props some values via the meetups data objects, and also forward the `togglefavorite` event to the parent component:

```svelte
<MeetupItem
        id={meetup.id}
        ...
        isFavorite={meetup.isFavorite}
        on:togglefavorite
    />
```

## `App`

Add a new `isFavorite` prop to both of the meetup data objects, default to false:

```js
let meetups = [
    {
        ...
        isFavorite: false
    },
    {
        ...
        isFavorite: false
    }
]
```

Create a new function named `toggleFavorite` with and `event` as a parameter, which finds the meetup item that triggered this function and updates the `isFavorite` data prop to toggle between `true` & `false`:

```js
function toggleFavorite(event) {
    const id = event.detail;
    // get the meetup that triggered the event
    // (spreading into a new object, to not manipulate the original)
    const updatedMeetup = { ...meetups.find(m => m.id === id) };
    // toggle the `isFavorite`
    updatedMeetup.isFavorite = !updatedMeetup.isFavorite;
    // find the index
    const meetupIndex = meetups.findIndex(m => m.id === id);
    // store the current object of meetups temporarily
    const updatedMeetups = [...meetups];
    // update the meetup triggering this event
    // using the index on the temp object
    updatedMeetups[meetupIndex] = updatedMeetup;
    // update the original meetups object with the updated temp one
    meetups = updatedMeetups;
}
```

Lastly, add the `on:togglefavorite` event on the `MeetupGrid` to execute this new `toggleFavorite` function whenever the event is triggered:

```svelte
<MeetupGrid
    {meetups}
    on:togglefavorite={toggleFavorite}
/>
```
