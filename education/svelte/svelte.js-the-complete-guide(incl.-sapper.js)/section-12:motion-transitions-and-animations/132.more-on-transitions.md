# 132. More on transitions

Transitions are cancelable as well.
So let's say that you have this component:

```svelte
<script>
    import { fade, fly, slide, scale } from 'svelte/transition';

    let showParagraph = false;
</script>

<button on:click={() => {showParagraph = !showParagraph}}>Toggle</button>

{#if showParagraph}
    <p transition:fly={{x: 300}}>Can you see me?</p>
{/if}
```

When ever the button is clicked, the paragraph flies in or flies out.
But when you click fast enough you'll see that the paragraph stops animating the fly in/out and reverts before the transition is done.
This is how the cancelable behavior works.

Also if you for example use such a toggle to hide a list of item, such as the boxes in our previous example, and then display all of them at once, the animation will play on all boxes at the same time.

If you don't want to run the animation if the whole list is changing state like this but only when 1 element is added to the list, use the `|local` decorator after the transition name: `transition:fly|local={{x: 300}}`.

## Events

When a transition is running it fires different event so that you can control the transition a bit more.

These are: `introstart`, `introend`, `outrostart`, and `outroend`, and can be used like this:

```svelte
<p 
    transition:fly={{x: 300}}
    on:introstart={() => console.log('Adding starts')}
    on:introend={() => console.log('Adding ends')}
    on:outrostart={() => console.log('Removing starts')}
    on:outroend={() => console.log('Removing ends')}
>
    Can you see me?
</p>
```
