# 128. Animating values with a tweened store

Some changes the user makes while using an application becomes clearer with animations, rather than just instantly making the change.

For example, let's say I have a progressbar that get's updated from `0` to `50` percent:

**App.svelte**
```svelte
<script>
    import { writable } from "svelte/store";

    const progress = writable(0);

    setTimeout(() => {
        progress.set(0.5);
    }, 1500);
</script>

<progress value={$progress}></progress>
```

With the above setup, it will change the value instantly, and the change is not that clear for the user as it could be.
It would be better if it was animated over time.

One way of achieving that in the above example, where we use a store to store the data, is by importing the `tweened` store from `svelte/motion`.
This store works as a `writable` store, but it's also animating the values as they change.
So we can simply replace `writable(0)` in the above example with `tweened(0)`, and it will animate the change:

```js
import { tweened } from 'svelte/motion';

const progress = tweened(0);
```

NOTE: tweened animates numbers and dates by default, but if you need to animate other data types you'll have to define how they should be animated using the `interpolate` function, which can be set in the `defaults` object as a second argument of the `tweened()` method.

You can also pass in an object as a second argument to the `tweened()` function to configure the animation:

```js
tweened(0, {
    delay: 0, // how long before the animation starts
    duration: 700, // duration of the animation in ms (default: 400)
    easing: () => {}, // easing function (svelte has some built-in)
    interpolator: () => {} // a function to animate data that can't be animated by default
});
```

About easing, one built-in easing function is `cubicIn` which can be imported from the `svelte/easing` package. Point to it in the `easing` defaults prop to use it:

```js
const progress = tweened(0, {
    delay: 0,
    duration: 700,
    easing: cubicIn,
});
```
