# 129. Using a spring store instead

Similar to `tweened`, `spring` is also a store that animates when a value change.
`tweened` however is more linear with it's animations, while `spring` is more physics based.

So whenever you need a more natural animation that get's influenced by some physics, use `spring` instead of `tweened`.

As is with `tweened`, `spring` also works out of the box for numbers and dates, but can be configured to animate other data types as well.
The second argument to the `spring()` function also takes in some options to set initially:

```js
spring(initValue, {
    stiffness: 0.15 // number between 0 & 1 where higher means a `tighter` spring (default 0.15)
    damping: 0.8 // number between 0 & 1 where lower means a `springier` spring (default 0.8)
    precision 0.01 // number between 0 & 1 determines the threshold at which the spring is considered to have `settled`, where lower means more precise (default 0.01)
});
```
