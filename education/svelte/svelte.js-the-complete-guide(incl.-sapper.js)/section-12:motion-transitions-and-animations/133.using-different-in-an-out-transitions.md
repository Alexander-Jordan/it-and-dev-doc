# 133. Using different `in` and `out` transitions

You can use the `in:transition` and `out:transition` syntax to specify different transitions for in and out animations:

```svelte
<p
    in:fade
    out:fly={{x: 300}}
>
    Can you see me?
</p>
```

NOTE: when using different transitions this way, the transitions are no longer cancelable.
