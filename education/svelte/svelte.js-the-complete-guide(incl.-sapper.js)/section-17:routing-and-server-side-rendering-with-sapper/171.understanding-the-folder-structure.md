# 171. Understanding the folder structure

[SvelteKit docs: Project structure](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/project-structure)

- `src`

    This is like before the folder that contains the meat of your application

    - `lib`

        This is where your components resides, like UI (presentational) components and stateful components (for example `MeetupItem`).

    - `routes`

        This contains all your routes. Routes are specified using folders and their names. For example the `about` folder refers to `/about`.

        Routes with a slug name are defined as folders named with square brackets (`[]`) and the slug name in-between (for example `[slug]`).

        - `+page.svelte`
        
            What to display for the given route.

        - `+page.js`

            JS code to be run for this route.

        - `+layout.svelte`
        
            A template which all child routes will use as a base.

        - `+layout.js`
        
            JS code to be run for all child routes.

        - `+error.svelte`
        
            what to display when something fails.

    - `app.html`

        The HTML page template

- `static`

    Any static assets that should be served as-is, like `robots.txt` or `favicon.png`

- `svelte.config.js`

    Your Svelte and SvelteKit configurations.

- `vite.config.js`

    A SvelteKit project is really just a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) project that uses the [@sveltejs/kit/vite](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/modules#sveltejs-kit-vite) plugin, along with any other [Vite configuration](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
