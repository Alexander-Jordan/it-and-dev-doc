# 170. What and why?

## Why Sapper?

### Routing (multiple pages)

Even in a SPA, you want to have multiple URLs (entry points) for your app

Sapper allows you to map components to URL paths

### Server-side rendering (SSR)

SSR can speed up the first render (work is moved to server) and improve search engine optimization (SEO)

Sapper ships with built-in server-side (pre-)rendering of your Svelte components

## What is Sapper?

Svelte is used to create the rendered application, but Sapper is used to handle all other parts that a web application need, such as server-side rendering and routing.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Sapper is a predecessor of [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).
So all future chapters about Sapper will be written for SvelteKit instead, resulting in more links to SvelteKit doc and maybe shorter explanations.
