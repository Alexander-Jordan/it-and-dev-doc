# 37. Using inline functions

I'd recommend to define functions in the script block, and then use them in the markup, even if the functions are small.

But you could also use inline functions in the markup, by using an arrow function.
That would look like:

```svelte
<button on:click{() => { ... }}>
<!-- OR -->
<button on:click{(parameter) => { ... }}>
<!-- OR if you have only one statement in the function you can skip the functions curly braces -->
<button on:click{(event) => event.preventDefault()}>
```
