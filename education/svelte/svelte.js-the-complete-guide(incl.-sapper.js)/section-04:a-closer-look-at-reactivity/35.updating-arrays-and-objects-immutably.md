# 35. Updating arrays & objects immutably

An important rule to remember in Svelte is that in order to update something in the DOM reactively, you need to reassign the variable to a new value.
That's why we couldn't only use `array.push()`, because this never reassign the array.
So instead we used the spread syntax (`...`) as we reassigned the value of the array.

NOTE: you could also do `array = array.push()`, since you are reassigning the value of the array variable.

The reason this is with arrays is because arrays are reference types, and not a primitive type.

The basic difference is that primitive variables store the actual values, whereas reference variables store the addresses of the objects they refer to.
