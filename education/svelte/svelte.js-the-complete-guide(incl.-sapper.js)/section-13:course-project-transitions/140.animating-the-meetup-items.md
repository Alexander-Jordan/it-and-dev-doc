# 140. Animating the meetup items

Let's first add a scale transition directly on the `<article>` element in the `MeetupItem` component:

```svelte
<article transition:scale>
...
</article>
```

This works well when toggling the filtering, but notice that the animation isn't working properly when adding a new item.
To fix this, we need to bind each item to a unique identifier when we iterate over them in the `MeetupGrid` component. You can do that via the `id` prop of the meetup items:

```svelte
{#each filteredMeetups as meetup (meetup.id)}
    <MeetupItem
        ...
    />
{/each}
```

Now animating should work properly when adding a new meetup!

But the existing item are not animated when a new item is added. To fix this you could use the `flip` animation:

```svelte
<article transition:scale animate:flip>
```

But notice the Svelte error: `An element that uses the animate directive must be the immediate child of a keyed each block`

Svelte tells us that it cannot animate with the flip animation (which takes in to account the order of a list) on elements that are not a direct child of a keyed each block, which the `<article>` element in `MeetupItem.svelte` isn't.
But we can't add animations on the `<MeetupItem>` tag in `MeetupGrid.svelte` either, since it's a custom Svelte tag.

How to come around this issue is to wrap the `<MeetupItem>` tag with a `<div>` tag, on which we add our transitions to instead. Also, let's specify a smaller duration on the flip animation so that it's not so slow:

```svelte
{#each filteredMeetups as meetup (meetup.id)}
    <div transition:scale animate:flip={{ duration: 300 }}>
        <MeetupItem
            ...
        />
    </div>
{/each}
```
