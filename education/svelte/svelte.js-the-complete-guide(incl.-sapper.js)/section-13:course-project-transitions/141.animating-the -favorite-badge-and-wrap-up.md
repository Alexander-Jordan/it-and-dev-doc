# 141. Animating the `Favorite` badge & wrap up

Simply add a `slide` transition to the `<span>` tag in the `Badge` component:

```svelte
<span transition:slide><slot /></span>
```

We didn't add any animations through a `tweened` or `spring` store, but that's because we don't really change any data like this that makes sense to animate.
