# 188. Building the app

## Svelte app

Running `npm run build` in the svelte course project will create your `bundle.js` file in the `public` folder.

This file could be used in any HTML file by including it.

Or you can simply use the entire `public` folder to deploy it on a host server, in order to have a single page application.

## Svelte-kit app

The same command is used to build: `npm run build`.

But there are potentially more steps required.
