# 93. Exploring different validation solutions

We could go in many different ways to validate fields.

One way could be to check the validation for every field, and let each `TextInput` component handle if it is valid or not, and showing an error message when applicable.

But we might want to keep those fields stateless, which means we can't do that.

Instead what we will try to do is to add validation to the `EditMeetup` component.
