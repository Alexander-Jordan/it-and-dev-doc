# 105. Managing store subscriptions

Let's say that we can toggle the cart with a button:

```svelte
<script>
  import Cart from "./Cart/Cart.svelte";
  import Products from "./Products/Products.svelte";
  import Button from "./UI/Button.svelte";

  let showCart = true;
</script>

<Button on:click={() => {showCart = !showCart}}>Toggle Cart</Button>
{#if showCart}
  <Cart />
{/if}
<Products />
```

This means that the `Cart` component will be re-created every time we reset the `showCart` variable to `true`.
All code in the `Cart` component will be run every time, and be fully removed when the toggle is off.
Except for the store's `subscribe()` function.
It will run every time, but the events will not be cleared when the component is removed automatically, causing us to have multiple events running in the background.

How to clear the subscriptions, we could use what the `subscribe()` function returns: a `unsubscribe()` function:

```js
const unsubscribe = cartItems.subscribe(ci => {
    items = ci;
});
```

We can then run this during the `onDestroy` event we learned about earlier:

```svelte
<script>
  import { onDestroy } from 'svelte'
  import cartItems from './cart-store.js';
  import CartItem from "./CartItem.svelte";

  let items;

  const unsubscribe = cartItems.subscribe(ci => {
    items = ci;
  });

  onDestroy(() => {
    if (unsubscribe) {
      unsubscribe();
    }
  })
</script>
```

With that in place we avoid memory leaks.
So it's important to always remember to unsubscribe to store's subscription's when a component using them are destroyed!
