# 103. Updating store data

We want to update the cart store from the `Product` component, where we can add a product to the cart.

Import the store as we did before, but this time in the `Product` component:

```js
import cartItems from '../Cart/cart-store.js'
```

What we can do now is update the store inside the `addToCart()` function, and it will be updated.
One way could be to use the store's `set()` function, to set it to the value we want.
Setting it to an empty array overwrites all items in the store with an empty array:

```js
function addToCart() {
    cartItems.set([])
}
```

Test this by clicking one of the `Add to Cart` buttons.

But this is not what we want to do in this case.
Instead we can use the store's `update()` function to update it.
The callback function of this will give a variable which holds the current value of the store, which we can then update:

```js
function addToCart() {
    cartItems.update(ci => {
        return [
        ...ci,
        {
            id: id,
            title: title,
            price: price
        }
        ]
    })
}
```

To make this work without errors related to unique IDs, change the IDs of the store's default cart items to `p3` & `p4`.

Test adding one of each item to the cart.
