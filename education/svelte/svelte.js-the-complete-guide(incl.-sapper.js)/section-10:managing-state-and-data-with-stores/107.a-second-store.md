# 107. A second store

First of let's update the cart store when we remove click the `Remove from Cart` button inside the `CartItem` component.
Inside the `removeFromCart()` function, use the store's `update()` function as we did before, but this time filter the store value to not include the item with the currently matched id, and return that:

```js
function removeFromCart() {
    cartItems.update(items => {
        return items.filter(i => i.id !== id);
    });
}
```

Don't forget to import the cart store (as `cartItems` in this case)!

## Adding a second store

Let's also add a store for the products, that are currently stored and managed in the `Products` component.

Add a new file to the `Products` folder, named `products-store.js`, and inside it create a new const variable which is defined as a new writable store with the default value of the items found in the `Products` component, and export it:

```js
import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

export const products = writable([
    {
        id: "p1",
        title: "A Book",
        price: 9.99,
        description: "A great book!"
    },
    {
        id: "p2",
        title: "A Carpet",
        price: 99.99,
        description: "Red and green."
    }
]);
```

In `Products.svelte`, remove the `products` variable entirely and import the store:

```js
import { products } from './products-store.js'
```

Now add the `$` to the `products` variable in the `each` loop in the markup, to tell Svelte that this is a store:

```svelte
{#each $products as product (product.id)}
```
