# 104. Stores & stateful & presentational components

Because we are using a store inside the `Product` component, it technically makes it a somewhat stateful component. This might not be something you want, but instead you could also update the store from the `Products` component instead, making the `Product` component truly a presentational component only.

You shouldn't be using stores if you just want to handle a click in a component, direct component communication are great for this.

But as we see, stores are a great tool for managing data between components that are not directly communicating with each other, or are not supposed to pass around data with each other.
