# 102. Creating a writable store & subscribing

## Writable stores

```
`set()` or `update()` (input/event) --> `writable()` --> `subscribe()` (output data)
```

Let's create a writable store to the cart.
Add a new file in the `Cart` folder, named `cart-store.js` (this can be called anything).
Inside, import the `writable` function from `svelte/store`:

```js
import { writable } from 'svelte/store';
```

Add a constant named `cart`, and assign it to a new writable store:

```js
const cart = writable([]);
```

Inside the writable function we pass in the default value for this store, which could be anything, in this case an empty array.
But since we have some items already added in the `Cart.svelte` file, let's add these as the default value to the store:

```js
const cart = writable([
    {
        id: "p1",
        title: "Test",
        price: 9.99
    },
    {
        id: "p2",
        title: "Test",
        price: 9.99
    }
]);
```

To use this store, you need to export it:

```js
const cart = writable([
    ...
]);

export default cart;
```

You can now import it in the appropriate file, in this case `Cart.svelte` (you can name the function anything when importing, since it's exported as the default function):

```js
import cartItems from './cart-store.js';
```

We can the use this store's `subscribe()` function to listen to any changes to this store, and update anything else we define inside of that functions callback.

Replace the declaration of the `items` variable with a simple version, where we just define the `items` variable, without giving it a default value:

```js
let items;
```

Under it, use the `subscribe()` function to set the `items` variable to be equal to the updated value of the `cartItems` store, whenever it changes:

```js
let items;

cartItems.subscribe(ci => {
    // this will set `items` to the value of `cartItems` (`ci`), whenever it changes
    items = ci;
});
```
