# 108. Subscribing for a short period

Let's use this new products store in `CartItem.svelte` to display the description of an item.
First import the store, and add a new variable named `description`, with a default value to `Not available!`:

```js
...
import { products } from '../Products/products-store.js';
...
let description = 'Not available!';
...
```

You could update the description variable by using the store's subscribe function as you did before, but this will force us to store all products from the store in a separate variable, which we then use to fetch the description for a specific item in the cart.

Instead, we could subscribe, get the data we need (description), and then immediately unsubscribe, directly in for example the `displayDescription()` function:

```js
function displayDescription() {
    showDescription = !showDescription;
    const unsubscribe = products.subscribe(ps => {
        description = ps.find(p => p.id === id).description;
    })
    unsubscribe();
}
```

This means we don't need to save any unnecessary data from the store, but only fetch what we want, when we need it.

Lastly, display the `description` in the markup:

```svelte
{#if showDescription}
    <p>{description}</p>
{/if}
```
