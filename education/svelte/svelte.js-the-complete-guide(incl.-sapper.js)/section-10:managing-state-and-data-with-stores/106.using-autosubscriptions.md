# 106. Using autosubscriptions

What we have learned is good to know, but we have a shortcut for this specific case where we subscribe a variable to a stores value, and unsubscribe whenever the component is destroyed.

We can use the `$` sign before the name of our store's variable name (in our case `cartItems`) to tell Svelte that this is a store we want automatic subscription and unsubscription to.

This means we can remove all this in the `Cart` component:

```js
let items;

const unsubscribe = cartItems.subscribe(ci => {
    items = ci;
});

onDestroy(() => {
    if (unsubscribe) {
        unsubscribe();
    }
})
```

And update the `each` loop in the markup to iterate on `$cartItems` instead:

```svelte
{#each $cartItems as item (item.id)}
    <CartItem id={item.id} title={item.title} price={item.price} />
{:else}
    <p>No items in cart yet!</p>
{/each}
```

This makes the code a lot cleaner.

But first way is good to know if you need to manipulate, or calculate on, the store's data before you use it for example.
So it's great to know this as well.
