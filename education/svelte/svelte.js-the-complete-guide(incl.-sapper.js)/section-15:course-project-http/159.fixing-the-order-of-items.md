# 159. Fixing the order of items

When we add meetups to the database, they are appended to the end, which is the opposite of how we do with the store.

It's an easy fix by using the `reverse()` Array function.
When you set meetups after fetching them in `App.svelte`, reverse the `loadedMeetups`:

**App.svelte**
```js
...
meetups.setMeetups(loadedMeetups.reverse());
...
```

Now the ordering should be correct!
