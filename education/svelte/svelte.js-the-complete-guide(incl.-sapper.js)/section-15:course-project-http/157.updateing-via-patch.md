# 157. Updating via PATCH

In `EditMeetup.svelte`, let's update the `submitForm()` function so that when we have an ID we update the existing meetup in Firebase before we update the meetup in the meetups store:

```js
...
if (id) {
    fetch(
        `<your-firebase-url>/meetups/${id}.json`,
        {
            method: 'PATCH',
            body: JSON.stringify(meetupData),
            headers: {
                'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            }
        }
    )
        .then(response => {
            if (!response.ok) {
                throw new Error('An error occurred, please try again!');
            }
            meetups.updateMeetup(id, meetupData)
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.log(error);
        });
} else {
    ...
}
...
```

Let's explain this a bit:

- `PATCH` is used to modify existing data partially or fully. In contrast, `PUT` is used to modify existing data completely (what you provide is what is saved, and what you don't provide is removed)
- `<your-firebase-url>/meetups/${id}.json` targets a specific meetup depending on the ID (to use variables inside strings we'll use backticks instead of single quotation marks, and specify variable like `${variable}`)

Now you should be able to update your meetups, and it should be saved to the database!
