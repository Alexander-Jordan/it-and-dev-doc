# 6. Writing Some Svelte Code

## Explain App.svelte

We will go through Svelte syntax step by step in this course.

But in the `App.svelte` file we have a `<h1>` tag with `Hello {name}!` inside.
These curly brackets is Svelte syntax, and the `name` part is a variable declared in the script block.
The `export` part means that this variable can be set outside of this component.

The value is set in the `main.js` file, where it is set to `world`.
This is how we setup props, or properties, in a svelte component.

At the end, what is rendered on the screen is `Hello world!`.

## Making it dynamic

Change the value of the `name` property in `main.js` to your name.
Add a new variable in `App.svelte` below the `name` variable without exporting it: `let age = 30;`
Add a normal JS function to the script block:

```js
function incrementAge() {
    age +1;
}
```

Change the contents of the `<h1>` tag to: `Hello {name}, my age is {age}.`.

Now add a `<button>` element below the `<h1>`.
As an attribute, add this Svelte syntax: `on:click="{incrementAge}"`.
This will hook up the button to run this function when clicked on.
The `age` variable will update dynamically as it gets incremented.

Make sure that the `npm run dev` command is running when you save, or run it after you have saved your changes.
This will build the project for you, and you can see the changes.
