# 3. What is Svelte?

Svelte is meant to be used to build a slim, light-weight application, that is still powerful and fast.

Achieved by the fact that it is a `compiler`, not a `framework` (in contrary to React, Angular, or Vue for example).

## Compiler vs framework

When using a framework, the user downloads not only the code written in that framework, but also the framework itself in order to understand the code.

Because Svelte is no framework, there is no extra code to be downloaded than the code itself. It instead compiles the code at build-time (before being deployed on production).

At the end, all that your Svelte code compiles to is vanilla JS code.

This let you develop your modern web application using the powerful Svelte syntax and features, and then ship it as light-weight vanilla JS code.
