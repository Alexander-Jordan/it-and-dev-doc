# 148. Things to consider

## Initial code in `onMount()`

In some cases it doesn't really matter, but it's a good practice to run initial code in components inside the `onMount()` callback function.
That means that in out example it's better to include the fetch GET request inside this:

```js
onMount(() => {
    fetch('<your-firebase-database-url>/hobbies.json')
        .then(response => {
            if (!response.ok) {
                throw new Error('Failed');
            }
            return response.json();
        })
        .then(data => {
            hobbies = Object.values(data);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            console.log(error);
        });
});
```

## Don't define outer scoped variables in async functions

If you would for example define the `hobbies` variable inside the fetch GET request function it would lead to errors.
That is because Svelte will not wait for this request to finish before rendering the rest of the component, and therefor it will be rendered without the VARIABLE, not only the value.

## Load on initial fetch as well

Also, set `isLoading` properly throughout the fetch GET request as you did with the POST request to show the loading text on page load:

```js
onMount(() => {
    isLoading = true;
    fetch('<your-firebase-database-url>/hobbies.json')
        .then(response => {
            if (!response.ok) {
                throw new Error('Failed');
            }
            return response.json();
        })
        .then(data => {
            isLoading = false;
            hobbies = Object.values(data);
        })
        .catch(error => {
            isLoading = false;
            console.log(error);
        });
});
```
