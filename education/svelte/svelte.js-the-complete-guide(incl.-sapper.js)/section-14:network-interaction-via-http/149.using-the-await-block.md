# 149. Using the `await` block

You could also in some cases store the result of a GET request in a variable, and then use the `await` block to show a loading text while waiting on the response, and then displaying the data or an error if one is catched:

**script block:**
```js
let getHobbies = fetch('<your-firebase-database-url>/hobbies.json')
    .then(response => {
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error('Failed');
        }
        return response.json();
    })
    .then(data => {
        isLoading = false;
        hobbies = Object.values(data);
        return hobbies;
    })
    .catch(error => {
        isLoading = false;
        console.log(error);
    });
```

**markdown:**
```svelte
{#await getHobbies}
    <p>Loading...</p>
{:then hobbyData} 
    <ul>
        {#each hobbyData as hobby}
            <li>{hobby}</li>
        {/each}
    </ul>
{:catch error}
    <p>{error.message}</p>
{/await}
```

In this example though if you add a new hobby to the list, the list doesn't update.
This is because we are only iterating over the fetched list on our database when the component is mounted, and not over the updated list.

In some cases, the `await` block could be useful, but in this case it's better to revert to how it worked before.
