# 41. Project setup & a first component

This course project will be a meet-up app.

## Add some structure

A recommendation is to have a folder for specific features, and some shared or general folders.

In the `src` folder, add a new folder named `Meetups`, which should hold all components that relates directly to meet-ups like a list of meets-ups for example.

Secondly add a new folder named `UI` in the `src` folder, which will contain more general components.

## Components

It's important to remember that your Svelte app will be build out of building blocks called `components`.

## First additions to `App.svelte`

Let's start by adding a clear header for the app.

Wrap the existing `<h1>` tag with a `<header>` tag, and change the content of the `<h1>` tag to `MeetUs`:

```html
<header>
    <h1>MeetUs</h1>
</header>
```

Add some styling in the style block:

```css
header {
    position: fixed;
    width: 100%;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    height: 4rem;
    background: #cf0056;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.26);
}

h1 {
    color: white;
    font-family: 'Roboto Slab', serif;
    margin: 0;
}
```

## Moving the header into a separated component

What we did is not utilizing components as we should, so instead we'll move what we added into a header component.

Create a new file in the `UI` folder named `Header.svelte`.

Move all we added into this `Header` component.
In the `App.svelte` file, import the it and add it to the markup like `<Header />`:

```svelte
<script>
  import Header from "./UI/Header.svelte";
</script>

<Header />
```
