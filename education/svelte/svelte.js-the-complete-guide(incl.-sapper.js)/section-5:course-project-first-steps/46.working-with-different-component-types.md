# 46. Working with different component types

NOTE: no official differentiation!

## Stateful components

Hold & manage data, pass data around.
Only a few (depending on app size) per app.

### Examples:

- `<App>`
- `<Products>`
- `<Checkout>`
- ...

## Presentational components

Receive & output data.
Use any!

### Examples: 

- `<Modal>`
- `<Card>`
- `<Button>`
- ...

## Reason

To help keep the project more maintainable.
