# 84. Relying on automatic number conversion

## Number input doesn't convert input to a number type

```svelte
<input type="number" value={price} on:input={event => console.log(event.target.value)}>
```

Just because the `<input>` is of type `number`, it doesn't mean that the value is converted into a number type.
Instead the input element will turn this into a string.

This could lead to unexpected behavior, and you'll have to convert the string to a number manually

## Automatic number conversion

If we use `bind` to bind the value, it will automatically convert into a number:

```svelte
<script>
    let price = 0;
    $: console.log(price);
</script>

<input type="number" bind:value={price}>
```
