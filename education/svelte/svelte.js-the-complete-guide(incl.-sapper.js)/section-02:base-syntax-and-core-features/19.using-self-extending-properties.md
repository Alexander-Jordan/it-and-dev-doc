# 19. Using self-extended properties

When setting up the prop values on a component, like we do in `App.svelte` when adding the `<ContactCard />` tag, we can use a shortcut for some cases.

When a prop (variable) name of a component (`ContactCard`) is the same name as the component that initiates it (`App.svelte`), we don't need to write it out like `variableName="{variableName}"`.
We can instead just type out `{variableName}`.

So if we make sure that the variables in `App.svelte` and `ContactCard.svelte` match, then `<ContactCard />` tag can be simplified to:

```svelte
<ContactCard
	{name}
	{userImgSrc}
	{jobTitle}
	{description}
/>
```

NOTE: I chose to change the name of the `userName` variable in `ContactCard.svelte` to `name`, to match the variable name in `App.svelte`. Make sure to adjust the rest of the content of the `ContactCard` component so that the correct variable name is used everywhere.

Save, and make sure everything is working as before.
