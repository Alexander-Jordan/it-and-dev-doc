# 17. Components & communication via props

We want to add dynamic contents to the `ContactCard` component.

## Add variable to component

Let's add a script block and define some variables (data) to be used by the component:

```svelte
<script>
    export let userName;
</script>
```

The `export` key is actually a hijacked JS feature, which in a svelte component means that the value of this variable can be set outside this component when it's instantiated.
This will let us define the value of `userName` of a `ContactCard` inside `App.svelte`.
Without this `export` it will not be possible to set this value from the `App.svelte` file.

But first let's use it inside `ContactCard` by changing the content of the `<h1>` tag inside the `user-data` div element from `User Name` to `{userName}`.

## Set value of component props

Now to set the value of `userName`, in `App.svelte` add `userName="{name}"` to the `<ContactCard />` tag as an attribute (prop):

```svelte
<ContactCard userName="{name}" />
```

This sets the value of the `userName` variable in the `ContactCard` component.
This could also be hardcoded to something else, but here we use the `name` variable defined in the `App.svelte` file.

So now when you save, the user name of the contact-card will update to whatever name you type into the `<input>` field.
