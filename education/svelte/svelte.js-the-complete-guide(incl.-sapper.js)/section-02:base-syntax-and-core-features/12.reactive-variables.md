# 12. Reactive Variables

## Labeled statement

[Doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/label)

Not used that much in JS, but a labeled statement is any word followed by a colon: `anything:`.

Since it's not used that often in JS, Svelte steals this syntax (more precise `$:`) and rewrite it's meaning.

## $:

The `$:` syntax is used to define a new variable that change according to an expression.

For example, `$: uppercaseName = name.toUpperCase()` defines a new variable called `uppercaseName`, that change it's value whenever the `name` variable changes, and then modify it's value to uppercase.

To test this, add a new `<button>` element with a `on:click="{changeName}"` added as a attribute.
Create a new function in the script block:

```js
function changeName() {
    name = 'Your-full-name'
}
```

Lastly replace he `Hello {name}` part with `Hello {uppercaseName}`.
When reloading the page it will say `Hello ...` and the value of the `uppercaseName` variable (which is the value of `name`, but uppercase).
Clicking the button will change the value of `name` to `Your-full-name`, but what get's printed on the page is `YOUR-FULL-NAME`, the updated value of `uppercaseName`.

This will help keeping the curly braces in the markup simple, as is the goal.
