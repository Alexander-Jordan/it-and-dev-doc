### Required features

`Data` -> `Output` (Print text, OR Change CSS class, OR Set HTML attribute/property, etc.)

`Input/Change` (Text entered into input, OR Button clicked, OR Data loaded from server (not (directly) triggered by user), etc.) -> `Data`

In conclusion, we need to be able to handle change from 2 points: input & output.
When something is changed, the we need to be able to dynamically apply that change to our web application.
