# 116. Setting up a store

Create a new file in the `Meetups` folder, named `meetups-store.js`, and create a new writable store named `meetups`.
Add the initial meetups from `App.svelte` as the initial value to this store, and export the store as default:

**meetups.store.js**
```js
import { writable } from 'svelte/store';

const meetups = writable([
    {
        id: 'm1',
        title: 'Coding Bootcamp',
        subtitle: 'Learn to code in 2 hours',
        description: 'In this meetup, we will have some experts that teach you how to code!',
        imageUrl: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/JavaScript_code.png/640px-JavaScript_code.png',
        address: '27th Nerd Road, 32523 New York',
        contactEmail: 'code@test.com',
        isFavorite: false
    },
    {
        id: 'm2',
        title: 'Swim Together',
        subtitle: 'Let\'s go for some swimming',
        description: 'We will simply swim a bit!',
        imageUrl: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Polar_bear_swimming.jpg/640px-Polar_bear_swimming.jpg',
        address: '2nd Beach Avenue, 13231 New Zealand',
        contactEmail: 'swim@test.com',
        isFavorite: false
    }
]);

export default meetups;
```

In `App.svelte` we can replace the `meetups` variable with an import of this new store:

**App.svelte**
```js
// this replaces `let meetups = [ ... ];`
import meetups from './Meetups/meetups-store.js';
```

We will fix all broken stuff soon, but you can as a final thing for this chapter update the `<MeetupGrid>` at the bottom of `App.svelte` to:

```svelte
<MeetupGrid
    meetups={$meetups}
    on:togglefavorite={toggleFavorite}
/>
```
