# 122. Adding a `delete` functionality

Add a new `removeMeetup` function with an ID as a parameter for the meetups store, use the stores `update` function to filter the items, and only return the items which are not equal to the provided ID:

```js
...
removeMeetup: (id) => {
    meetups.update(items => {
        return items.filter(i => i.id !== id);
    });
},
...
```

In `EditMeetup.svelte`, add a new function named `deleteMeetup` which runs this new function whenever triggered, and finally dispatches a `save` event:

```js
function deleteMeetup() {
    meetups.removeMeetup(id)
    dispatch('save');
}
```

Now in the markdown, add a conditional `Delete` button inside the `footer`, which should be rendered whenever the `id` prop on this component is set, and run the `deleteMeetup` function whenever this button is clicked:

```svelte
{#if id}
    <Button on:click={deleteMeetup}>
        Delete
    </Button>
{/if}
```

Now you should be able to delete meetups!
