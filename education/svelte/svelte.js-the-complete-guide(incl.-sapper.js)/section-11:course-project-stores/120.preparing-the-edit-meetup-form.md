# 120. Preparing the `Edit Meetup` form

We will update the `EditMeetup` component so that we can use it to not only add new meetups, but also edit existing meetups.

First add and export a property named `id` with a default value of `null`:

```js
...
export let id = null;
...
```

Let's subscribe for a short period to the meetups store, if the id is set.
In this subscribe function we will filter for the meetup matching the ID, and assign all data variables to the data of the selected meetup:

```js
...
if (id) {
    const unsubscribe = meetups.subscribe(items => {
        const selectedMeetup = items.find(i => i.id === id);
        title = selectedMeetup.title;
        subtitle = selectedMeetup.subtitle;
        address = selectedMeetup.address;
        email = selectedMeetup.contactEmail;
        description = selectedMeetup.description;
        imageUrl = selectedMeetup.imageUrl;
    })

    unsubscribe();
}
...
```

Update the `submitForm` function to only run the stores `addMeetup` function when an id is not set, and run a `updateMeetup` function, that we will create on the store, when the id is set:

```js
function submitForm() {
    const meetupData = {
        title: title,
        subtitle: subtitle,
        description: description,
        imageUrl: imageUrl,
        address: address,
        contactEmail: email
    }

    if (id) {
        meetups.updateMeetup(id, meetupData)
    } else {
        meetups.addMeetup(meetupData);
    }
    dispatch('save')
}
```
