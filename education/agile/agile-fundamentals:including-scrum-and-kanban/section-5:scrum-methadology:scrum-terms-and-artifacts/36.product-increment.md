# 36. Product Increment

>A potentially shippable, vertical slice of a solution that is created as part of a Sprint time-box.

## Example

### Traditional (waterfall):

Analysis->Requirements->Design->Develop/Build->Test->Release

You move from left to right, never going back.

### Agile:

| Product Increment 1 | Product Increment 2 | Product Increment 3 | ... |
|---|---|---|---|
| Analysis, Requirements, Design, Build, Test, Release | A, R, D, B, T, R | A, R, D, B, T, R | ... |

## Another example

An app on your phone is updated sometimes every week.

Instead of shipping all features and updates in a sum, it is instead split up in parts.
