# 75-81.Scrumban

>Takes the best of both Scrum and Kanban and combines them

- Visualize workflow with a Kanban board
- Utilizes daily scrum
- Work is pulled, rather than assigned
- Strict work in progress (WIP) limits
- Project team roles not clearly specified
- Specialized team members

## Debate: Sprint

Since the framework can vary depending on what is included from Scrum and Kanban, some debates can arise.

A hot topic is using sprints (a timebox) or not.

## Continuous flow

- Fluid movement of work (no timeboxes)
- Pull items into `Doing` based on team capacity
- Plan at a certain number of `To do` items
- Lead and cycle time are the key metrics

## Timeboxed (sprint)

- Utilized sprints (1-4 weeks)
- Iteration planning, reviews, and retrospectives
- Uses `Ready` status to organize work items
- Uses lead and cycle time or burndown charts

### Normally statuses are:

| Backlog | Ready | Doing | Done |
|---|---|---|---|
| Story 1 | Story 3 | Story 5 | Story 7 |
| Story 2 |  | Story 8 |  |
| Story 4 |  |  |  |

## Feature freeze

- Used as the project deadline is approaching
- Team identifies most important features not yet done
- Remainder of work items are frozen
- Focuses the team's energy on finishing critical tasks

## Target audience/organization

- A organization uses Scrum but need a more unstructured methodology (like a first step before fully go to Kanban)
- A very specialized organization that can't adapt the Scrum methodology
- Any organization really that want to adapt the Scrumban methodology
