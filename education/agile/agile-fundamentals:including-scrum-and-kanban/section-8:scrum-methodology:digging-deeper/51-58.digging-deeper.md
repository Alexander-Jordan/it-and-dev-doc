# 51. Stats

## Team Velocity

What is the average total Story Points we can complete as a team per sprint?

| Product Backlog | Commited (in sprint) | Completed (in sprint)
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 3 | 3 | 3 |
| 3 | 3 | 3 |
| 2 | 2 | 1 |
| 5 | 1 | 5 |
| 3 | 5 | 1 |
| 3 | 1 | **Actual velocity: 10 points** |
| 1 | **Estimated velocity: 12 points** | |
| 5 | | |
| 1 | | |
| 2 | | |
| **Total points: 28** |  |  |

Overtime you can review how you did with the help of previous sprints.
This will help for future sprint estimates.

## Burndown chart

![burndown-chart](./images/burndown-chart.png)

A diagram revealing the trend of a project:
- **Vertical axis**: Story Points
- **Horizontal axis**: Sprints
- One line representing the goal trajectory (orange)
- One line with a data point for each sprint showing the actual amount of Story Points at a certain Sprint (blue)

This will help reveal if the current trend is going up or down.

## Burn up chart

Since the plan can change during a project, and many things are uncertain, there's an alternative tool to the Burndown chart: Burn up chart

![burn-up-chart](./images/burn-up-chart.png)

- **Vertical axis**: Story Points
- **Horizontal axis**: Sprints
- One line with a data point for each sprint representing the total amount of Story Points for this project (orange)
- One line with a data point for each sprint showing the amount of Story Points that has been completed (blue)

Comparing both charts with each other on the same set of data, it shows that te Burndown chart doesn't give you all the information as the Burn up chart do.

## Chart for non-fibonacci estimates

You can use them, but they are not as useful.

Instead of Story point, you could have number of User Stories.
Doesn't take account to the actual size of the stories.

Or sizes any other framework can be converted in to arbitrary number, such as the fibonacci sequence.

## Responsibilities

The Scrum Master creates the charts.
Or if you use an automated tool, then that is taken care of that way.
