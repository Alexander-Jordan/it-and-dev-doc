# 37-38. Estimating in Agile

## Estimating

Roughly calculating how long it's going to take to complete.
Or an educated guess.

### What will help you:
- Elicited information (what is needed)
- Past experinces
- Documentation

## For Agile

### Not Agile:
- Absolute estimate
- Measured in days
- Updates usually cause major impacts

### Agile
- Relative estimate
- Placed into a bucket
- Updates usually cause minor impacts

Estimates are more sized from small, to medium, to big, relative to other similar sized user stories.

### Why?

- Provides estimated duration
- Drives out clarification questions
- Highlights complex and high risk tasks

In other words: it opens up clarity, communication, and understandability.
