# 15-16. Benefits & Challenges of Using Agile

### Benefits:

Agile was creating due to the pitfalls of the traditional waterfall methodology.
Waterfall is built on phases, have to finish them to continue, and difficult to go back.
You have to know a lot up-front.
Phases are alot longer periods.

Agile allows you to deliver value in smaller packages.
End result is more result, faster, and more feedback.

### Challenges:

If teams already use another method, it's a big step in changing the mindset to use Agile.
You need to commit to it 100%.

Agile is more about communication instead of documentation.
That can be challenging in the aftermath.

Due to the lack of documentation, future projects don't have as many resources from previous projects.

There's no real role.
Everybody works together equally.
If something goes in the wrong direction, no one is naturally responsible to take the lead.
