# 5-7. Introduction & Agile Values

### What is agile?
More a mindset than a framework.
4 values, 12 principles.

### Value 1: Individuals and interactions > Processes and tools
We will value Face to Face communications.
Estimates should focus more on the interactions and communication than on actual result.

### Value 2: Working software > Comprehensive documentation
Have more impactful communications.
Fail faster = learn faster (no need for comprehensive documentation in that state).

### Value 3: Customer collaboration > Contract negotiation
When writing contracts: have the customers success in mind.
Win win situation: when the customer wins, you win.

### Value 4: Responding to change > Following a plan
Value being ready for/responding to changes.
Most likely something will change and the initial plan will not be useful.
>"Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face." - Mike Tyson.
